flag{5d402e}: Start DATATIME: Sunday End DATATIME: Tuesday. Total time spend: 3h
For this flag I just spend lot of time searching for differet ways
of performing client-side attacks. First I treid to know how to use BeEF
by installing it and tried to connect to one IP Adress but I didnt managed
do it so I tried other things. The second thing I tried was using fatrat
as I found one youtube video that seemed interessting to perform client-side
attack but at one point I didnt know how to manage using metasploit and fatrat
at the same time to achive the client-side attack. 
So after lots of hours searching inside the sea turtle machine I found that maybe 
I could redirect Redirect one of the ip that is in /etc/php-dns/dns_records.json to
my personal IP adress of my computer.
